# MindChat: Platform for Mindful Conversations

Description:

The Mental Health Chatbot website provides a platform for users to interact with an AI-powered chatbot to discuss their mental health. The chatbot asks a series of 10 questions related to mental health and stores the responses in a yes/no format. If the user answers "no" to more than 5 questions, the chatbot suggests consulting a therapist.

The website has a clean and user-friendly design. The navigation bar at the top features the title "Mental Health Chatbot," providing a clear indication of the website's purpose. The main content is displayed within a chatbot container, which is positioned at the center of the page and is responsive to different screen sizes.

The chatbot container includes a chat log, where the user's responses and the chatbot's messages are displayed in separate chat bubbles. The chat log is scrollable, allowing users to view past conversations. Below the chat log, there is an input section with a text input field and a send button. Users can type their answers in the input field and submit them by clicking the send button.

The website incorporates a responsive design, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction across various devices and screen sizes. Media queries have been implemented to adjust the dimensions of the chatbot container based on the screen width. This ensures a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Overall, the Mental Health Chatbot website provides a convenient and accessible platform for users to engage in a conversation about their mental well-being. It aims to offer guidance and support while encouraging users to seek professional help when needed.
